## Reasons for organising a BH

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Hackathons have a good strategy to build bridges over traditional
research teams</li>
<li class="fragment">the out of the box ideas are potentially
accelerated thanks to the multidisciplinary teams and  stimulate the
environment</li>
</ul>

## ..and also

*  Different levels of expertise to assess the ideas of opening up research insights
*  Potentially a great agile extension to the more structured
collaboration between multiple investigators and institutions


## BH's aims

*  Elixir Hackathon wants to encourage developers to collaborate and develop solutions, ideas, simple and more complex codes 
*  During hacks participant should show practical implementations in
   Elixir communities and platforms during intensive and productive
   coding sessions
* Common challenges proposed by the sister BioHackathon organised in
Japan

## Propose and select hacking projects

*  Most of the topics should aligned to challenges proposed by ELIXIR
   platforms (data, tools, compute, interoperability and training),
   ELIXIR communities
* Advance the development of an open-source infrastructure for data
  integration to accelerate scientific innovation focusing on
  technology implementations of FAIR
* Strengthen the interactions between ELIXIR Platforms and Communities to establish and reinforce collaborations
